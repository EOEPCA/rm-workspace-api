# Workspace API
<a name="introduction"></a>

The EOEPCA **Workspace API** is an HTTP interface that allows workspace teams onboarded to an EOEPCA based platformâ€”as well as other connected EOEPCA Building Blocksâ€”to retrieve detailed information about their individual workspace(s).

For version 2, the API is extended to expose additional status information for all fields defined in the Workspace Kubernetes Custom Resource (Workspace CR) of the respective team. The Workspace API also allows users to manage key workspace characteristics such as connected storage buckets and team members, either via API or (soon) via the UI. See the corresponding [Workspace CRD] 
(https://eoepca.readthedocs.io/projects/workspace/en/latest/api/workspace/) for the full API contract.

Additionally, the API enables platform operators to create new workspaces or delete existing ones.

> ðŸ’¡ EOEPCA Workspace API v2 is currently in development and is scheduled for release in autumn 2025!

## Key Features
<a name="key-features"></a>

For a broader context, refer to the [Workspace BB](https://eoepca.readthedocs.io/projects/workspace), as the Workspace API serves as a thin layer on top, making workspace details more accessible to end users.

Some specific API details (mainly targeting v1 but still relvant) are outlined in the [Wiki Pages](https://github.com/EOEPCA/rm-workspace-api/wiki)

An OpenAPI specification is published as well â€” see [https://workspace-api.apx.develop.eoepca.org/docs](https://workspace-api.apx.develop.eoepca.org/docs)

## Contributing

To use the Workspace API, you need to run it against a cluster with the Workspace Building Block installed. The easiest way to get started is by connecting to the `eoepca-demo` cluster with your `KUBECONFIG` set up accordingly:

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config-eoepca-demo HARBOR_URL="" HARBOR_ADMIN_USERNAME="" HARBOR_ADMIN_PASSWORD="" PREFIX_FOR_NAME="ws" WORKSPACE_SECRET_NAME="workspace" uvicorn --reload --host=0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --log-level=info --reload workspace_api:app
```

ðŸ’¡ Relevant VS Code configuration files are included to support a streamlined, opinionated development setup.

For v2, a VUE.js-based UI is included with the API bundle. To build or update the UI distribution folder, run:

```bash
cd workspace_ui

npm install
npm run build
```

> ðŸ’¡ The UI bundle is still under active development and disabled by default. Use `?devmode=true` to enable it.
